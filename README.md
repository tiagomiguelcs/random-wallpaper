# The Random Wallpaper Bash Script
Set the **same** random wallpaper on multiple monitors without any "fancy" app. 

# How to Install
1. Clone this repository and change to its directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tiagomiguelcs/random-wallpaper.git
$ cd random-wallpaper
```
2. Run the script
```
./rwallpaper
```
3. In your desktop settings, set the wallpaper to the one defined in the script (e.g., ```~/Pictures/twall/today.jpg```

4. Add the following line to your ``.profile`` file in order to set a random wallpaper each time you log in:
```
[path_to_repo]/rwallpaper
```
Don't forget to replace ``path_to_repo`` with the actual path of the repo. 

5. Enjoy! For a set of awesome wallpapers, I suggest those available [here](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers).
